# App-Icon
Daily UI Challenge

I started the Daily UI challenge to improve my Interface Design Skills.
On this day, I was asked to design an app icon.

My app icon is for an app that serves people with thick, kinky, coily and curly hair.
I chose a detangling comb as the logo because the purpose of the app was to help users 'detangle' their problems with their natural hair.
The colors purple and black were chosen becasue purple represents loyalty and I would like users to feel like their hair is their crown and that makes them royalty. The color black was chosen because majority of the people with thick, kinky, coily or curly hair are of the Black race.
